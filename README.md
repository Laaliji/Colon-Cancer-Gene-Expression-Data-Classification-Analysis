## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of colon cancer gene expression data using various machine learning classification techniques. The project aims to classify tissue samples as either normal or cancerous based on gene expression patterns.

## Research Context

Colon cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes. This project explores how gene expression patterns can be leveraged to develop accurate diagnostic tools for colon cancer detection.

## Dataset

The dataset contains gene expression values from colon tissue samples:
- Original source: Kaggle "Gene Expression of Colon Cancer" dataset
- Features: Expression levels of various genes
- Target: Binary classification (normal vs. cancer)

## Methodology

The analysis follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Feature standardization
   - Train/test split (80%/20%)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Class distribution analysis
   - Statistical description of gene expressions
   - Visualization of data distributions

3. **Model Implementation and Evaluation**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest

4. **Performance Analysis**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrices
   - ROC curves and AUC analysis

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**
   - Identification of most significant genes
   - Biological interpretation of findings
